## Description

This application was created as the start of a full stack social media application using a MongoDB database, Express.js routing, and the Mongoose ODM. It sets up the initial CRUD API routes for the application which allow users to be created, searched for, updated, and deleted. Users can also share their thoughts, react to friends' thoughts, create a friend list, and subsequently delete thoughts, reactions, friends, and themselves as a user.

## Features

Features of this application include the ability to create users/thoughts, find all users/thoughts, find a single user/single thought, update user/thought information, and delete a user/thought. The ability to add reactions to particular thoughts, and friends to users is also a notable feature -> when a thought, reaction, or friend is added to the database, it will update within the user object accordingly.

## Usage Information

As of now the usage of this application can be conducted through spinning up the server with npm run start and then heading over to an application like Insomnia to test different API end points.
